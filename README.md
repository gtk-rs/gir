# GIR

`GIR` is a project that helps for generating safe Rust bindings for GObject based libraries. The generated bindings consists of two parts: FFI (the unsafe 1:1 C API calls from Rust) and the safe high-level safe Rust API.

## How to use

A work in progress book to help with learning how to use `gir` along with a tutorial are available at <https://gtk-rs.org/gir/book>.
