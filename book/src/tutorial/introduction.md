# Tutorial
In this tutorial, we go through all the steps needed to generate a safe wrapper for a C library. We start with finding the .gir files needed and end with generating the documentation. We also look at a few common errors and how to fix them. Because this can be a bit abstract sometimes, we use the creation of the bindings for pango as an example. The example continues through all of the chapters of the tutorial. If you follow along until the end, you will have generated a safe wrapper including the documentation. In case you are stuck at any point or there are other errors and you can't figure out what's going on, don't hesitate to reach us so we can give you a hand!

Let's dive right into it and set up our project folder!
