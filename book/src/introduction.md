# Introduction
[gir] is a tool to automatically generate bindings and a safe wrapper for a library written in C. All you need to be able to use it, is a `.gir` file containing the [GObject introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) data for the library you want to create the bindings for, as well as the `.gir` files for all its dependencies. Have a look at the tutorial if you don't know how to [find the .gir files](tutorial/finding_gir_files.md). If your library does not provide a `.gir` file, unfortunately you cannot use [gir], but maybe you can try [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

This book contains a tutorial on how to use gir. As an example we will create the bindings for pango. In many cases you will be able to follow the same steps with your library. If you are already familiar with gir and you just want to look up details about the configuration files, feel free to skip ahead to the documentation of the [configuration files](config/introduction.md).

## General steps
[gir] tries to make it as simple as possible to generate a safe wrapper for your C library. The process can be divided into four steps that correspond to the four operating modes gir has.

- Generating unsafe bindings:
In this step, the low-level FFI bindings are created from the supplied `*.gir` file. These are essentially direct calls into the related C library and are typically unsafe. The resulting crate is typically appended with -sys. The operating mode is `sys`.

- Generating a safe wrapper:
Next, another crate for a layer on top of these unsafe (sys) bindings is created, which makes them safe for use in general Rust. The operating mode is `normal`.

- Checking for missing types/methods:
The operating mode `not_bound` allows you to see the detected types/methods that will not be generated for whatever reasons.

- Adding documentation:
After the safe wrapper is created, gir can even generate the documentation for us. Use the operating mode `doc` to do so.


## Regenerating the bindings and wrapper
In order to generate the bindings and the wrapper for the first time, the above mentioned steps should be followed. When you want to regenerate the crates because e.g. the library was updated, you can simplify the process by running the helper script `./generator.py`. The script detects `Gir.toml` configurations in the current directory (or the paths passed on the command-line) and generates "normal" or "sys" crates for it. Alternatively --embed-docs can be passed to prepare source-code for a documentation built by moving all documentation into it. For a complete overview of available options, pass --help.

## GIR format reference
It can always be useful to look at the [reference](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/annotations/giannotations.html) or [schema](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gobject-introspection/blob/master/docs/gir-1.2.rnc).
