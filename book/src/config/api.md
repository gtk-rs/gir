# API Options

This mode requires you to write another TOML file.
[gtk/Gir.toml](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk/blob/master/Gir.toml) is a good example.

```toml
[options]
girs_directories = ["gir-files"]
library = "Gtk"
version = "3.0"
min_cfg_version = "3.4"
target_path = "."
# Path where objects generated (defaults to <target_path>/src/auto)
# auto_path = "src/auto"
work_mode = "normal"
# Whether the library uses https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gi-docgen for its documentation
use_gi_docgen = false
generate_safety_asserts = true
deprecate_by_min_version = true
# With this option enabled, versions for gir and gir-files saved only to one file to minimize noise,
# can also take path to the directory for saving "versions.txt" or filename with extension.
# Relative to target_path
single_version_file = true
# Trust the nullability information about return values. If this is disabled
# then any pointer return type is assumed to be nullable unless there is an
# explicit override for it.
# This has to be used carefully as many libraries are missing nullable
# annotations for return values, which then will cause a panic once an
# unexpected NULL is returned.
trust_return_value_nullability = false
# Disable running `cargo fmt` on generated files
# (defaults to false)
disable_format = true
# Always generate a Builder if possible. This is mostly a convenient setter as most of the
# time you might want the Builder to be generated. Ignoring none-desired ones can still be done with per object `generate_builder` configuration.
# (defaults to false)
generate_builder = true
```

This mode generates only the specified objects.
You can either add the object's fullname to the `generate` array or add it to the `manual` array (but in this case, it won't be generated, just used in other functions/methods instead of generating an "ignored" argument).
Example:

```toml
generate = ["Gtk.Widget", "Gtk.Window"]
manual = ["Gtk.Button"]
```

So in here, both `GtkWidget` and `GtkWindow` will be fully generated and functions/methods using `GtkButton` will be uncommented.
To generate code for all global functions, add `Gtk.*` to the `generate` array.

To also generate a `Builder` struct for a widget, it needs to be set with the `generate_builder` flag in object configuration:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.TreeView"
status = "generate"
generate_builder = true
```

> If the object doesn't already have a `Default` implementation through a constructor method without arguments, generating a `Builder` struct will add a `Default` implementation for the object.

If you want to remove warning messages about the not bound `Builders` during the generation you don't want to be generated, you can ignore them with the `generate_builder` flag in object configuration:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.TreeView"
status = "generate"
generate_builder = false
```

If there is some work which has to be done post-construction before the builder's
`build` method returns, you can set the `builder_postprocess` value in the object configuration:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.Application"
status = "generate"
generate_builder = true
builder_postprocess = "Application::register_startup_hook(&ret);"
```

For the duration of the code in `builder_postprocess` the binding `ret` will be the
value to be returned from the `build` method.

Sometimes Gir understands the object definition incorrectly or the `.gir` file contains an incomplete or wrong definition, to fix it, you can use the full object configuration:

```toml
[[object]]
# object's fullname
name = "Gtk.SomeClass"
# can be also "manual" and "ignore" but it's simpler to just put the object in the same array
status = "generate"
# replace the parameter name for the child in child properties (instead "child")
child_name = "item"
# mark object as final type, i.e. one without any further subclasses. this
# will not generate trait SomeClassExt for this object, but implement all
# functions in impl SomeClass
final_type = true
# mark the object as a fundamental type in case the GIR file lacks the annotation
# note that fundamental types don't make use of IsA/Cast traits and you should
# implement something similar manually
# gir is only capable for generating the type definitions along with their functions
fundamental_type = false
# mark the enum as exhaustive. This must only be done if it is impossible for
# the C library to add new variants to the enum at a later time but allows
# for more optimal code to be generated.

    # generate only `connect_property_events_notify`, without `get_property_events` and `set_property_events`
    # supported values: "get", "set", "notify"
    generate = ["notify"]
```

Since there are no child properties in `.gir` files, it needs to be added for classes manually:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.SomeClassWithChildProperties"
status = "generate"
# replace parameter name for child in child properties (instead of "child")
child_name = "item"
# define concrete child type (instead of "Widget")
child_type = "Gtk.MenuItem"
    [[object.child_prop]]
    name = "position"
    type = "gint"
    doc_hidden = true
```

For enumerations and bitflags, you can configure the members and mark the type
as `#[must_use]`:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gdk.EventType"
status = "generate"
# generates #[must_use] attribute for the type
must_use = true
# override starting version
version = "3.12"
    [[object.member]]
    name = "2button_press"
    # allows to skip elements with bad names, other members with same value used instead
    alias = true
    # Allow to add a cfg condition
    cfg_condition = "target_os = \"linux\""
    # In case you don't want to generate the documentation for this member.
    generate_doc = false
    [[object.member]]
    name = "touchpad_pinch"
    # define starting version when member added
    version = "3.18"
```

For enumerations and bitflags, you can also configure additional `#[derive()]`
clauses optionally conditioned to a `cfg`.

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gst.Format"
status = "generate"
    [[object.derive]]
    name = "Serialize, Deserialize"
    cfg_condition = "feature = \"serde\""
```

For global functions, the members can be configured by configuring the `Gtk.*` object:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.*"
status = "generate"
    [[object.function]]
    name = "stock_list_ids"
    # allows to ignore global functions
    ignore = true
    # allows to define if the function was moved to a trait 
    doc_trait_name = "StockExt"
    # allows to define if the function was moved to a struct
    doc_struct_name = "Stock"
    # In case you don't want to generate the documentation for this function.
    generate_doc = false
```

Which will prevent gir from generating `stock_list_ids`.
If you want to specify
that a function will be manually implemented, you can use:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.Entry"
status = "generate"
    [[object.function]]
    name = "get_invisible_char"
    manual = true
```

This will prevent gir from generating `get_invisible_char` and it won't generate
`get_property_invisible_char` which would have been generated if we had used
"ignore = true".

Note that you must not place `Gtk.*` into the `generate` array and
additionally configure its members.

You can control the generation of constants in a similar fashion:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.*"
status = "generate"
    [[object.constant]]
    pattern = "*"
    # No constants will be generated
    ignore = true
    # In case you don't want to generate the documentation for this constant.
    generate_doc = false
```

Constants also support `version` and `cfg_condition` fields.

In various cases, GObjects or boxed types can be used from multiple threads
and have certain concurrency guarantees.
This can be configured with the
`concurrency` setting at the top-level options or per object.
It will
automatically implement the `Send` and `Sync` traits for the resulting object
and set appropriate trait bounds for signal callbacks.
The default is `none`,
and apart from that `send` and `send+sync` are supported.

```toml
[[object]]
# object's fullname
name = "Gtk.SomeClass"
# can be also "manual" and "ignore" but it's simpler to just put the object in the same array
status = "generate"
# concurrency of the object, default is set in the top-level options or
# otherwise "none". Valid values are "none", "send" and "send+sync"
concurrency = "send+sync"
```

Note that `send` is only valid for types that are either not reference counted
(i.e. `clone()` copies the object) or that are read-only (i.e. no API for
mutating the object exists).
`send+sync` is valid if the type can be sent to
different threads and all API allows simultaneous calls from different threads
due to internal locking via e.g. a mutex.

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.Something"
status = "manual"
# Can also be "ref-mut", "ref-immut"
ref_mode = "ref"
```

When manually generating bindings, it can happen that the reference mode
detected by GIR is different than what was implemented and conversion to the C
types are wrong in autogenerated functions that have such objects as argument.
This can be overridden with the `ref_mode` configuration.

Getters are automatically renamed to comply with Rust codying style guidelines.
However, this can cause name clashes with existing functions.
If you want to
bypass the automatic renaming mechanism, use `bypass_auto_rename = true`:

```toml
[[object]]
name = "Gtk.TextBuffer"
[...]
    [[object.function]]
    name = "get_insert"
    # Avoid clash with the `insert` operation.
    bypass_auto_rename = true
```

Some constructors are not annotated as `constructor` in the `gir` files.
In
order for the naming convention to be applied, you can force a function to be
considered as a constructor:

```toml
[[object.function]]
name = "new_for_path"
# Not annotated as constructor in Gir => force it to apply naming convention
constructor = true
```

## conversion_type "Option"

The `conversion_type` variant `Option` is available for types `T` implementing
`glib::TryFromGlib<Error=GlibNoneError>`.
As a reminder, this allows
implementing `FromGlib` for `Option<T>` and usually goes alongside with `ToGlib`
for both `T` and `Option<T>`.
In this case, `Option<T>` will be used for return
values (including ffi output arguments).
For in-arguments, except if the
parameter is declared `mandatory`, `impl Into<Option<T>>` so that either an
`Option<T>` or `T` can be used.

Ex. from `gstreamer-rs`:

``` rust
[[object]]
name = "Gst.ClockTime"
status = "manual"
conversion_type = "Option"
```

The type `ClockTime` implements `glib::TryFromGlib<Error=GlibNoneError>` (and
`OptionToGlib`), which means that its Rust representation can take advantage of
`Option<ClockTime>`.

Additionally, the user can instruct `gir` to `expect` `Some` or `Ok` results for
specific arguments or return values.
E.g.:

``` rust
[[object]]
name = "Gst.Clock"
status = "generate"
manual_traits = ["ClockExtManual"]
    [[object.function]]
    name = "get_calibration"
        [[object.function.parameter]]
        name = "internal"
        mandatory = true
```

In the above example, the user instructs gir to consider the `internal` argument (which also happens to be an out argument) with type gir `Gst.ClockTime` can be represented as a `ClockTime` without the `Option`.
This argument is actually part of a set of output arguments.
With the above gir declaration, the generated signature is the following (the implementation takes care of `expect`ing the value to be defined):

``` rust
    fn get_calibration(
        &self,
    ) -> (
        ClockTime,
        Option<ClockTime>,
        Option<ClockTime>,
        Option<ClockTime>,
    );
```

For a return value, the mandatory declaration reads:

``` rust
    [[object.function]]
    name = "util_get_timestamp"
    /.../
        [object.function.return]
        # always returns a value
        mandatory = true
```

## conversion_type "Result"

The `conversion_type` variant `Result` is available for types `T` implementing
`glib::TryFromGlib<Error=Err>` where `Err` is neither `GlibNoneError` nor
`GlibNoneOrInvalidError`.
In this case, `Result<T, ErrorType>` will be used for
return values (including `ffi` output arguments) and the type itself in argument
position.

In `gstreamer-rs`, the C type `GstStateChangeReturn` can represent both a
successful or an error return value.
In Rust, the `Result` `enum` is the idiomatic way of returning an error.
In `gstreamer-rs`, bindings to functions
returning `GstStateChangeReturn` had to be manually implemented so as to return `Result<StateChangeSuccess, StateChangeError>`.
Note that in this case, the type implementing `TryFromGlib` is `StateChangeSuccess` and not
`GstStateChangeReturn`.
These functions can be auto-generated using:

``` rust
[[object]]
name = "Gst.StateChangeReturn"
status = "generate"
must_use = true
    [object.conversion_type]
    variant = "Result"
    ok_type = "gst::StateChangeSuccess"
    err_type = "gst::StateChangeError"
```

## Boxed types vs. BoxedInline types

For boxed types / records, gir auto-detects `copy`/`free` or `ref`/`unref`
function pairs for memory management on records.
It falls back to generic `g_boxed_copy`/`g_boxed_free` if these are not found, based on an existing implementation of `get_type`.
Otherwise no record implementation can be generated.

This works for the majority of boxed types, which are literally boxed: their
memory is always allocated on the heap and memory management is left to the C library.
Some boxed types, however, are special and in C code they are usually allocated on the stack or inline inside another struct.
As such, their struct definition is public and part of the API/ABI.
Usually these types are relatively small and allocated regularly, which would make heap allocations costly.

These special boxed types are usually allocated by the caller of the C
functions, and the functions are then only filling in the memory and taking
values of this type as `(out caller-allocates)` parameters.

In most other bindings, heap allocations are used for these boxed types too
but in Rust we can do better and actually allocate them on the stack or inline
inside another struct.

Gir calls these special boxed types "boxed inline".

```toml
[[object]]
name = "GLib.TreeIter"
status = "generate"
boxed_inline = true
```

For inline-allocated boxed types it is possible to provide Rust expressions in
the configuration for initializing newly allocated memory for them, to copy
from one value into another one, and to free any resources that might be
stored in values of that boxed types.

By default the memory is zero-initialized and copying is done via
`std::ptr::copy()`.
If the boxed type contains memory that needs to be freed
then these functions must be provided.

The following configuration is equivalent with the one above.

```toml
[[object]]
name = "GLib.TreeIter"
status = "generate"
boxed_inline = true
init_function_expression = "|_ptr| ()"
copy_into_function_expression = "|dest, src| { std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(src, dest, 1); }"
clear_function_expression = "|_ptr| ()"
```

## Generation in API mode

To generate the Rust-user API level, The command is very similar to the previous one.
It's better to not put this output in the same directory as where the FFI files are.
Just run:

```sh
cargo run --release -- -c YourGirFile.toml -d ../gir-files -o the-output-directory
```

Now it should be done.
Just go to the output directory (so `the-output-directory/auto` in our case) and try to build using `cargo build`.
Don't forget to update your dependencies in both projects: nothing much to do in the FFI/sys one but the Rust-user API level will need to have a dependency over the FFI/sys one.

Now, at your crate entry point (generally `lib.rs`), add the following to include all generated files:

```rust
pub use auto::*;
```

## Add manual bindings alongside generated code

Unfortunately, `gir` isn't perfect (yet) and will certainly not be able to generate all the code on its own.
So here's what a `gir` generated folder looks like:

```text
- your_folder
|
|- Cargo.toml
|- src
 |
 |- lib.rs
 |- auto
  |
  |- (all files generated by gir)
```

You can add your manual bindings directly inside the `src` folder (at the same level as `lib.rs`).
Then don't forget to reexport them.
Let's say you added a `Color` type in a `color.rs` file.
You need to add in `lib.rs`:

```rust
// We make the type public for the API users.
pub use color::Color;

mod color;
```
